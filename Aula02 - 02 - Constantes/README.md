# Learning about constants

- Constants store values ​​and after their initialization, no more changes are allowed
- Constants store primitive and referential values.
- They must be defined with the final word and its name in capital letters.

## Types / Capabilities / Properties

- byte (1 byte - 8 bits) / (-128-127) / Integers
- short (2 bytes - 16 bits) / (-32768 to +32767) / Integers
- int (4 bytes - 32 bits) / (-2147483648 to + 2147483647) / Integers
- long (8 bytes - 64 bits) / (-922337203685477808 to 922337203685477807) - Integers
- char (16-bit Unicode Characters) / (0 to 65536) / Characters (Only one character in these characteristics)
- float (4 bytes - 32 bits) / (approximately 3.40282347E+38) / floating point
- double (8bytes - 64 bits) / (1.79769313486231570W+308) / Floating Point
- boolean (True and false) / Boolean

## Strings

- String is not a primitive type, but it is one of the most used classes and accepts texts when assigned with "quotes".

## Resources
- The concern with saving resources must be applied even in the correct creation of the variables.
