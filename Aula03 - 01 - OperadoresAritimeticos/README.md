# Learning about Arithmetic Operators

- Arithmetic operators perform fundamental math operations between two variables and return the result.
- If it is necessary to write larger or more complex operations, we can combine these operators and create expressions, which allows us to perform all types of calculation programmatically.

## Operators

- Sum (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Module/Remainder (%)

## Usage Examples

    result = number1 + numberB
	result = number1 - numberB
	result = number1 * numberB
	result = number1 / numberB
	result = number1 % numberB
